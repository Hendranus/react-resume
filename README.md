# Hendranus' React Resume

This is the start of my react resume with server side rendering for printing to pdf.

The project can already render react to pdf file (build/downloads/resume.pdf), however components are still in early development.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project includes [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) for component design and testing.

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:Hendranus/react-resume.git
yarn
yarn build - to generate static react-resume deploy in build folder
yarn start - to start default create-react-server serving react-resume
yarn webpack - to build printer backend server
yarn serve - to start printer backend server
```
